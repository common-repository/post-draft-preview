Allow non logged-in users to check a draft of unpublished post by using secret link

== Description ==

Simple plugin enabling the publication of post drafts.
It allows preview of a draft without being logged to the WordPress admin panel.
Compatible with the Gutenberg and the Classic Editor.

== How it works ==

Content created in WordPress from the moment a post or page is added, but before it is published, receives draft status.
You can send the draft to someone else, but that person must have adequate access to the wp-admin section.
The problem arises when we want to show a draft of the post to people who do not have access to our wp-admin panel.
For this purpose, we have created the Post Draft Preview plugin.
